  <h1>What is the last of us?</h1>

  <p>Post-apocalyptic world where a fungal virus has infected the globe</p>
  <h1>What are the zombies and why are they connected to bio</h1>
  <p>
    The fungal virus converts humans into “zombies” that are hostile and
    quickly bring the downfall of humanity
  </p>
  <h1>Science</h1>
  <p>
    The fungus in the game is most similar and inspired by
    Cordyceps(Ophiocordyceps unilateralis) In nature the spores of the
    cordyceps take control of their host’s mind and motor functions, usually
    insects Once infected by the fungus it will drain all nutrients in the
    host and fill it with spores. It then manipulates its movements to seek
    higher ground where the spores leak out of the host in hope of spreading
    the spores to other insects.
  </p>
  <h1>Humans Effect</h1>
  <h2>So why does it not affect us?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Our effective immune system and our body temperature stop the fungi from
      growing
    </li>
    <li>Cordyceps have evolved to specifically target insects like ants</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Mutates for human</h1>
  <p>
    Hypothetically if it did mutate to humans it still would not be as bad as
    in the Last For Us, because it would not affect how aggressive the host
    is, so if an outbreak did happen the military would most definitely handle
    the problem one way or another

      The fungal virus converts humans into "zombies" that are hostile and
      quickly bring the downfall of humanity

    <h1>Science</h1>
    <hr class="solid" />
    <div class="flex">
      <ul>
        <li>
          The fungus in the game is most similar to and inspired by Cordyceps
          (Ophiocordyceps unilateralis).
        </li>
        <li>
          In nature the spores of the cordyceps take control of their host's
          mind and motor functions, usually insects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once infected by the fungus it will drain all nutrients in the host
          and fill it with spores. It then manipulates its movements to seek
          higher ground where the spores leak out of the host, hoping to
          spread the spores to other insects.
        </li>
        <li>
          The process in which cordyceps hijack neural and motor functions is
          by secreting neuromodulatory agents around the central and
          peripheral nervous system. Along with this process, it also contains
          bacteria that stop the chemical signaling ants use to communicate
          with one another
        </li>
        <li>
          Infected insects usually develop biting behavior which is a likely
          inspiration for the Last of Us zombies, but cordyceps is not known
          to increase host hostility.
        </li>
      </ul>

  <section data-aos="slide-left">
    <h1>Humans Effect</h1>
    <h2>So why does it not affect us?</h2>
    <hr class="solid" />
    <ul>
      <li>
        Our effective immune system and our body temperature stop the fungi
        from growing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cordyceps have evolved to specifically target insects like ants.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep in mind that our immune system is not impervious to fungal
        infection, for example many humans get athletes' feet or ringworms. It
        is just the case that cordyceps is not adapted for humans.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <section data-aos="slide-left">
    <h1>Hypothetical Scenario</h1>
    <hr class="solid" />
    <ul>
      <li>
        A cordyceps fungus evolved to infect humans would force the host's
        body to produce massive amounts of infectious spores.
      </li>
      <li>
        Infected people would be driven to high altitudes by the fungus,
        helping to spread spores through the air over vast areas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any physical trauma or ruptures to infected hosts would release
        concentrated spore loads into the environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Incineration may be the only way to fully destroy fungal bodies acting
        as spore sacs within human hosts.
      </li>
      <li>
        With an airborne, persistent infectivity, such an outbreak could
        rapidly become an uncontrolled pandemic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Infected people would be nothing like the hostile zombies in The Last
        of Us.
      </li>
      <li>
        While this scenario has speculative elements, it is based on the
        real-world characteristics of the cordyceps fungus.
      </li>
    </ul>
